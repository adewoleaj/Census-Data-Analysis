# Census Data Analysis Report


## Project Background Information

Every ten years, the United Kingdom undertakes a census of the population, with the most recent one having been conducted in 2021. The purpose of such a census is to compare different people across the nation and to provide the government with accurate statistics of the population to enable better planning, to develop policies, and to allocate certain funding.

## Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to make decisions regarding the utilization of an unoccupied plot of land and determine where to invest resources. To address these questions, thorough cleaning and analysis of the mock census data provided are required.

## About this Mock Census

The mock census contains randomly generated data using the Faker package in Python. It has been structured to emulate the format of the 1881 census of the UK, wherein only a few questions were asked of the population. The fields recorded include:
- Street Number (set to “1” if it is a unique dwelling)
- Street Name
- First Name of occupant
- Surname of occupant
- Age of occupant
- Relationship to the “Head” of the household
- Marital status
- Gender
- Occupation
- Infirmity
- Religion


## Introduction

Welcome to the Census Project Report, a comprehensive analysis of demographic and socioeconomic data aimed at providing strategic insights for informed decision-making. This report delves into various facets of census data from a moderate-sized town, offering a detailed examination of population demographics, employment trends, migration patterns, and more.

## Data Cleaning

The census data underwent meticulous cleaning procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability. This involved addressing missing values, standardizing data formats, and resolving inconsistencies across key variables such as religion, marital status, and occupation. Thorough documentation of the cleaning process was maintained to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

## Population Demographics



Through rigorous analysis, we gained valuable insights into the demographic composition of the town. This included an in-depth exploration of age distribution, occupational diversity, marital status distribution, and prevalence of infirmity among residents. Visual aids such as population pyramids and age distribution plots were employed to enhance comprehension of demographic trends.

## Data Insights and Analysis

The analysis unearthed significant insights into the socioeconomic landscape of the town. Key findings encompassed trends in religion, marriage and divorce rates, employment patterns, birth and mortality rates, as well as patterns of immigration and emigration. Statistical analyses and data visualization techniques were leveraged to derive meaningful conclusions and inform decision-making processes.

## Recommendations and Conclusions

Drawing upon the insights gleaned from the analysis, a series of strategic recommendations have been formulated to address pertinent issues and foster sustainable development within the community. These recommendations span a range of areas including housing infrastructure development, employment generation initiatives, elderly care provisions, and immigration policy enhancements. Each recommendation is underpinned by empirical evidence and geared towards nurturing long-term prosperity and well-being within the community.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of census data has provided valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of the town's population and socioeconomic fabric. By harnessing these insights, stakeholders are empowered to make data-driven decisions that contribute to the holistic advancement and prosperity of the community.
